## Conditionals
Many times we have to take a decision based on some conditions, for example, if we want to decide whether a person can vote or not, we need to check if the person is 18 years or older or not.
Such decision-making is done with the help of conditionals. Besides, conditional also help in maintaing control flow.

All the languages support conditonals in various ways, but majorly there are two main conditionals: 
> if- else

> switch

## if-else
> The if statement

The if statement is the most basic form of a conditional. 
It checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, the program continues with the next instruction. 
The basic syntax is
> if(condition){
> 
>     //code to be executed if condition is true.
> }

For example if we want to print hello when the integer variable 1 is pressed.(Note : The code is not specific to any language.)

      if (int a=1){
        print("Hello");
        }
        
> The if-else statement

The if-else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false. 
If the condition is true, the if block is executed; otherwise, the else block is executed.The basic syntax is
>if (condition) {
>
>    // code to be executed if the condition is true
>    
>} 
>
>else {
>
>    // code to be executed if the condition is false
>    
>}
